* Learning poverty.
    * Lack of basic proficiency in reading and math.

* These outcomes are a result of political choice.
    * Cascade down: politician -> bureaucracy -> public education.
    * How are these services managed? What can be done to promote better outcomes?

* Previous studies have focused how individual-level incentives shape the political management of bureaucracies.
    * Raffler, Gulzar and Pasquale.

* But politicians do not govern in a vacuum.
    * In particular, politicians are locked into power-sharing arrangements.
    * In my paper, I highlight how institutions shape decisions on how to manage the bureaucracy.

* Highlight the role of city councilors and what is their precise role in the community.
   * DO NOT villify them. They are trying to serve their community.
   * And an important way in which they do so is by creating jobs.

* I highlight how education, due to its high salience for politicians - but relatively low salience for voters - becomes an important bargaining chip for voters.
    * Positions in the education sector are exchanged in return for political support, similar to dynamics observed at the federal level.
    * In other words,executive-legislative bargain underpins the decision of how to manage the local bureaucracy.

* Why education?
    * A pending challenge for ensuring equitable access to high quality public services to the population.
    * Direct link between service providers (street-level bureaucracy) and the implementation of public services.
    * Generalizable: instead of focusing on a single program (NGER, developmental projects), many of the findings here are universal: how to ensure and facilitate learning, motivate staff and teachers to provide better quality education.

* Why Brazil.
    * Data rich.
    * Devleoping country that has dedicated resources to investing in education, but has only received mixed results.
    * As in many developing countries, public goods are appropriated by political elites in order to further their private agenda.
    
* Need to focus on the how political institutions shape management of bureaucracy.
    * Political administration is a fact.
* Highlight the nexus between bureaucratic output and "quality of bureaucracy."
    * Embedded autonomy, what did that even mean?
    * It means that the bureaucracy is not exposed to the short-term constraints of political agents.
    * Rather, it is able to implement policies that take time to mature.
    * What the cycles of disruption lead to is discontinuity in the implementation of policy, and a collapse of pre-existing plans and structure.
    * It is not so much the individual quality of the bureaucrats: it is the overall continuity of the policy implementation.
* Highlight how the accomodation 

* Long-term investments vs. short-term gains.
    * Public services are embedded within a larger framework.
    * In particular, public sector job allocation is a major bargaining chip for mayors.
